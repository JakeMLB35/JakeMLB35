# About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Python script that will rank college football teams strictly based on their wins and losses.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my most important relationships: my God, my wife, and my two kids!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was a member of the first Division I football team at the University of North Alabama.
